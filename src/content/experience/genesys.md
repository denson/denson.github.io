## CARD EX-03 — Data Scientist @ Genesys (Sep 2021–Apr 2025)

**1-line pitch:** Applied NLP and data platforms to turn enterprise support transcripts into actionable insights for employee and customer satisfaction. 
**Tags:** NLP · BERT · GPT-2 · UMAP · ETL · Drift Monitoring · Snowflake 

### Verbatim resume bullets

* "Analyzed performance of enterprise support systems with focus on employee and customer satisfaction; transformed support transcripts into actionable operational insights."
* "Engineered semantic embeddings using BERT and GPT-2; clustered embeddings with UMAP to surface latent sentiment patterns and drivers beyond traditional KPIs."
* "Built production ETL/feature pipelines and data architecture (schemas, governance, tooling) for transcript + operational datasets; implemented monitoring, drift detection, and alerting for reliability."
* "Architected a Snowflake-based metadata system to extract SQL schemas and create a business-aware data dictionary; used Snowflake's embedded small AI models to assist in generating and maintaining field-level business meaning."

### AI Context (expandable)

Situation: Large volumes of support transcripts obscured drivers of employee and customer satisfaction. 

Constraints: Enterprise data scale, governance requirements, and need for reliable monitoring. 

Action: Built embedding-based NLP pipelines and production ETL with drift monitoring and metadata tooling. 

Result: Augmented traditional KPIs with transcript-driven insights used by the business. 

**Business linkage:** Transcript-derived behavioral clusters were related to downstream outcomes such as churn, retention, and customer satisfaction; findings were multi-factor and required management interpretation rather than a single "soundbite" metric.

Lesson learned: Operational NLP requires robust pipelines, monitoring, and business-aligned metadata—not just models.
